Positive shadow price in a minimisation problem mean that an increase in the right-hand side value of a constraint by x unit will lead to an increase in the objective function value by x*shadow price. Here all the shadow prices are positive because we have to distribute all the supply vailable to us to fulfill the demand and for each tonne of supply increase there is a cost associated to distribute the same and hence it would not be possible to have negative shadow pries in this case. Eg: if I get 1 tonne extra supply then my cost will increase as I cannot distribute this additional supply for free, I have to bear a cost to distribute this extra milk supply to a demand centre."
